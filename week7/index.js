/* For exercise 1:
	in this file, attach an event handler to the image object you named in your HTML file
	(using getElementbyId and referring to the ID that you set in the HTML)
	The event handler should handle the "click" event and should simply swap the
	handle_up.jpg image with the handle_down.jpg image */
